# Applied-Statistics-with-R-Lab4
he last lab introduced you to SLR with a data set that had a non-linear trend. This meant
that a straight line was an inappropriate choice for a model. However, this model was
applied and some skills developed like plotting points, segments, adding the fitted line and
determining estimates of parameters from summary output and interpreting multiple 𝑅2
.
Today we will begin where the last lab left off and examine the assumptions of the linear
model. If the assumptions hold we say that the analysis performed is valid.
Objectives
In this lab you will learn how to:
1. Create a linear model with 𝑥2 and 𝑥 variables.
2. Create residual plots for two models and be able to compare and interpret them.
3. Create QQ plots and interpret them.
4. Create and interpret the Shapiro Wilk test.
5. Interpret regression summary output (similar to last lab).
6. Make predictions for the new model.
7. Learn about piecemeal regression.
8. Learn how to make an R package using the package roxygen2
